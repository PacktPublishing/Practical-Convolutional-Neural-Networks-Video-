# Practical Convolutional Neural Networks [Video]
This is the code repository for [Practical Convolutional Neural Networks [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/practical-convolutional-neural-networks-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789535037), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is revolutionizing several application domains such as visual recognition systems, self-driving cars, medical discoveries, innovative e-commerce, and more. You will learn to create innovative solutions around image and video analytics to solve complex machine learning- and computer vision-related problems and implement real-life CNN models. This course starts with an overview of deep neural networks using image classification as an example and walks you through building your first CNN: a human face detector. You will learn to use concepts such as transfer learning with CNN and auto-encoders to build very powerful models, even when little-supervised training data for labeled images is available. Later we build upon this to build advanced vision-related algorithms for object detection, instance segmentation, image captioning, attention mechanisms for vision, and recurrent models for vision. By the end of this course, you should be ready to implement advanced, effective, and efficient CNN models professionally or personally, by working on a complex image and video datasets.
